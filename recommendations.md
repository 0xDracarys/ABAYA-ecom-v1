# Recommendations for Fixing Next.js Server Component Issues

## 1. Fixed Issues

âœ… **Image onError Handler Issue**
- Created a `ClientImage` component to handle onError events properly
- Replaced direct Image usage with ClientImage in components that needed error handling
- This resolves the "Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props" error

âœ… **Loading Component Issues**
- Simplified loading.tsx components to not require imported components
- Used inline HTML/CSS for loading spinners
- Fixed "The default export of loading is not a React Component" error

## 2. Remaining Issues

ðŸ”„ **"Unsupported Server Component type" errors**

These errors indicate there are still serialization issues when passing data between server and client components. Here are recommended solutions:

### Check Component Boundaries
Review each page in `/app` directory, particularly:
- `/about`
- `/account`
- `/account/orders`
- `/categories`

Ensure that:
1. Complex objects or functions aren't being passed from server to client components
2. Event handlers are only in client components
3. Components with hooks like useState/useEffect have 'use client' directive

### Solution Strategies

#### 1. Add Client Directives
Add `'use client'` directive to components that use React hooks or browser APIs:
```tsx
'use client'
import { useState } from 'react'
// ...
```

#### 2. Split Server/Client Logic
```tsx
// ServerComponent.tsx (server component)
import ClientComponent from './ClientComponent'

export default function ServerComponent() {
  // Data fetching, etc.
  const data = { /* simple serializable data */ };
  
  return <ClientComponent data={data} />
}

// ClientComponent.tsx (client component)
'use client'
import { useState } from 'react'

export default function ClientComponent({ data }) {
  const [state, setState] = useState()
  // Interactive logic here
}
```

#### 3. Serialize Data
Make sure all data passed from server to client components is serializable:
- Objects should be plain objects (no methods, classes, etc.)
- Avoid circular references
- Functions can't be passed from server to client

## 3. Next Steps

1. **Run dev server with detailed error logging**:
   ```
   NODE_OPTIONS='--trace-warnings' npm run dev
   ```

2. **Examine failed page components** to identify specific serialization issues

3. **Address each page individually**:
   - Convert pages with heavy client-side logic to client components
   - Split pages into server/client components with clear boundaries
   - Use proper data serialization

4. **Re-test with build process** after each major fix

## 4. Prevention

Once fixed, consider implementing these practices to prevent future issues:

1. Create more client-side utility components (like ClientImage) for interactive elements
2. Use TypeScript to better distinguish serializable vs. non-serializable props
3. Add ESLint rules to catch server/client component boundary issues
4. Document server/client component patterns for your team
